# JSON to Graph Viewer

## Introduction
JSON to Graph Viewer is a simplified version of JSON Crack built with pure React, Zustand for state management, ShadCN UI components, and the Monaco Editor for code editing. This tool allows you to visualize JSON data as an interactive graph entirely in the browser, ensuring complete data privacy with no risk of data leakage.

This project is designed as a learning resource for developers interested in creating a JSON visualization tool from scratch using modern React technologies.
